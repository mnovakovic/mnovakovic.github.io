Being a more senior leader and even engineer means that you are expected to navigate uncertain situations and always be ready to come up with new solutions to your team's problems.
When I observe some of the people that I look up to, they never lack ideas on how to move forward and how to approach problems.

I always had issues with creative requirements of my work, even when it comes to tasks that seem less ambigous in nature, such as writing.
For example, in my masters we often had to write essays and I had so much trouble getting started and writing out the first few sentences.
I would easily get lost my in thoughts and would not know what direction to take. **I would often get stuck when I have to navigate uncertain situations.**

<!-- Or at work, throw me into a new area that I have to learn a lot about, such as a gigantic codebase or a novel framework/library,
or give me a complex problem to solve and I would find it hard to start.
We could go into some serious psycho-analysis here, but for simplicity, I would say that this is me lacking the ability to deal with uncertain situations and lacking creativity.
-->

I blame it on math, as I was always a math person and was never into something creative like writing/music/acting where you constantly have to create something out of nothing.
This is probably me generalizing the artists/writers too much but at least I imagine they operate.

<!--
## Real world is not like math

Math is very predictable, it is very black and white. There is set of very basic rules that everyone agrees on (i.e. axioms) and
everything we know about math is built on top of it. We can reconstruct the most complex math problems and break it down into a set of these very basic rules.
There is a beauty in how predictable math is.

Life, on the other hand, is not like math, it's very unpredictable and is never black and white. We all know that, but the older I get, the more obvious it is. There is no fixed set of rules for life, or at least even if there is,
such set is too complex for humans to understand it.

<!-- Life is full of unknowns and unpredictable elements that are outside your control. I was never a creative type. For example, I never played an instrument or was interested in music or painting/drawing. <!--  or generally speaking open to exploring any ideas that are not beyond reality. -->
<!--
Since I was never a creative type, I don't know if creative people find it easier to deal with uncertanity but I belive they do. When I worked at a gaming company, I was always blown away by how artists were able to
create and draw new characters. They always start with a blank screen, but very quickly they create some wonderful art that tells a story.
Being a new world or new characters, it seems like they have no issues going from a blank screen to something very beautiful and concrete.
Writers too.

<!-- Even though I enjoy math and it is what got me into engineering and arguably helped me even be capable to move to the Bay Area, it dit not prepare me for real life. I am not very well trained to deal with uncertanity. -->

## My approach to dealing with ambiguity

I had to dig into this issue concuously and find how other people approach it. Luckily there are many resources out there, and by trial and error I was able to get better at dealing with uncertain situations
full of ambiguity and unknowns. I am far from excelling at it, but at least right now I have a system in place that helps me.


The approach that I found works for me is very simple: **it all starts with a blank piece of paper and writing out possible next steps**. When you write *almost anything*, two things happen.
First, you force yourself to think about many different options, paths and outcomes, and even though most of them might be
not applicable, you narrow down the uncertanity and the world becomes more predictable.
Second, by writing things out, you don't have to keep it all in your head and you free up your brain to do the thinking instead of memorizing. <!-- (TODO: add more benefits). -->

Once you go through this simple exercise, you can go back to the list and categorize, reword and make it more organized.
This way you conciously narrow down the uncertanity and have some ideas on where to go next. You can then repeat the process if you
think you weren't as thorough. Reading the list and thinking about it would help you see if you need to do one or more passes.

After that, if you feel comfortable that you narrowed down the uncertanity and have one or more next steps, you can repeat the whole process, but this time with a much more concrete set of constraints.

# OLD

At least this is how it is when you're doing math in school, even for high-level math competitions in middle and high school.
Maybe if I was going for a PhD in math or doing some math-based job for living it would have to be different, but I don't know that.
Even though solving math problems can be extremely challenging and intelectually satisfying, it does not reflect life or prepare you for it.

On the other hand, creative types create something out of nothing, it's in the job description.
Sure they can get stuck (writer's block) but getting unstuck and navigating uncertanity is (at least in my interpretation) a basic skillset of creative types.
