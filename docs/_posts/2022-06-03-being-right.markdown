Most people would associate being wrong with something negative, and there is a lot of truth to that.
If you get the answer wrong on a school test or an interview, you might fail your test or not get the job.
If you bet your money on a company and the company fails, you lose money.
Very often, being wrong comes with a clear penalty.

But if we try to avoid being wrong, does that mean we have to be right? I learned that we don't have to be right to produce success and looking at the world from such a binary point of view doesn't lead to optimal results.
In the following few paragraphs I am describing my newly developer point of view.


## Everyone thinks they are right

I didn't even realize that everyone thinks they are right until I read the classic ["How to Win Friends and influence people"](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08JLM24Q8/r) by Dale Carnegie.
The book has a couple of chapters devoted to this phenomenon and it was an eye-opening experience for me. 
Once I read this, I started realizing how true it was.

It was easy to look back at the previous conflicts and realize that in all cases,
both (or all) sides thought they were right, while the other side was wrong.
I was the same way - I always tried so hard to prove others wrong. I would find articles, studies, and other arguments to prove my point.
But surprise - it *somehow* never worked. I would often leave the conflicts bitter, thinking how wrong the other side was.

You can do the same and think about your previous conflicts: if the argument gets heated and emotions start running high, even if you show
someone they are obviously wrong, they refuse to acknowledge that. For a second, they even might get taken by the realization
but after they collect themselves, they will start finding counterarguments and excuses as to why your proof is wrong.
Or sometimes, they will plainly resort to being rude.

I finally trained myself to be on the lookout for these situations and now I always try to quickly stop the urge to prove someone wrong. **Proving someone wrong is a trap, and I try to stay away from it.**

## Avoid the trap of trying to be right

I no longer try to prove the other side I am right and they are wrong.
Instead, I use the following approach every time I try to communicate with a different team - and so far I was able to completely avoid conflicts, which is far more than I expected when I made the change:

- **Start the conversation by showing empathy**. I now really try to understand the other side, and I explicitly state that.
    Everyone likes when they're being heard and are immediately more open to understanding your side of
    the story once you show you are willing to do the same.
    Any pushback to my ideas and proposals most probably has a genuine reason behind it.
- **Try to understand your own point of view.**
    As you encounter the pushbacks and feedback, try to understand if you overlooked some aspects.
    For example, why did I do things this way? Was I too narrowly focused on my idea? How does it affect other teams?
    Did I consider how my approach fits other people?
    Even if I understand my point of view - did I communicate this well.
- **Are we on the same page?**
    If I understand my own point of view and we're past the point of heated arguments, are we on the same page?
    For example, a team recently requested that I make a major change somewhere.
- **Search for the common ground.** If you understand each other and still disagree - is there a common set of interests that we can apply, i.e. can we make a compromise? 

Experiment with the above steps and you'll see immediate improvements in the way people respond to you.

## Learn to never be wrong

Another good suggestion is that instead of aiming to be right, you aim to not be wrong.
I read about this framing in Will's blog post [learn to never be wrong](https://lethain.com/learn-to-never-be-wrong/).
I highly recommend giving this post a read.
The ideas are very similar to what I described above, and Will recommends not trying to prove anyone wrong but trying to understand
everyone's point of view and aim to drive alignment that fits everyone's point of view, instead of trying to force your opinion on others.

## Parting thoughts

Some of the conflicts you encounter might be because either you or the other side is trying hard to prove the other side wrong.
If you recognize this pattern, you might be able to avoid some of these conflicting situations and even resolve them in a way that makes all parties happy.
