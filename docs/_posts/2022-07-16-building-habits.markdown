Sometimes a book or a movie makes the whole nation rethink the basic concepts, and I believe James Clear managed to do with his book [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits). 
If you haven't read the book, stop what you're doing and go read it. A lot of people I know have read it and they love it.
Habits are a known concepts but the book shines a light on how to easily build good habits, how to break the bad ones and how to make them work to your advantage. 

Good habits are a wonderful thing if you can make them work for you, and I'll try to explain how I started applying some of the concepts from the book in my personal life.

## Good habits benefit yourself and people around you

Imagine something as simple as washing your dishes the moment you're done eating. It's a wonderful habit, especially if you have roommates. Unfortunatelly, I was never able to form that habit. I would either completely forget about it and just drop the dishes in the sink or I would find an excuse to not do it. People who do it though, they do it without much thinking or effort on their end, making everyone's lives in the household easier in the process.

There's plenty of other habits that are benefitial in a similar way - drinking healthier drinks, eating healthier food or more rigorous variants such as counting calories or making sure your diet has appropriate micro and macro nutrients. It seems like so much effort, but if you observe people who actually do it, they don't struggle with it at all. And that's the best part of habits - they are free and they happen on autopilot.

Imagine being able to recognize some of these useful habits and make it easy to form them so that you start doing them with ease. I started applying it in my real life.

The Atomic Habits book goes into details on how to form these and I highly recommend going through them.

## Habits tricks that helped me

Ever since I read the book I started thinking about ways to apply the ideas in my personal life.

There are two ideas the book mentions that I found very useful:
- **Make a schedule and stick to it.** This one is super easy to apply, and it is very efficient. I managed to find it useful for many things. *This blog itself is a product of the schedule idea*: I wanted to get better and more comfortable at writing, so I dedicate two hours every week to it. I wake up and assure I have two hours to think about the ideas for my blog and work on a post. This helped tremendously - I am much more comfortable starting a blog topic from scratch. I use it for my [goal settings](goal-settings.html) and for sports activities. There's just something magically efficient about dedicating a schedule on a regular basis and sticking to it. I plan to use more of it.

- **Stack the habits.** This essentially means connecting a new habit to a well stablished one. It's an "if then" of habits. For example, now I pick up the thrash from the car when I park and throw it out on my way to the front doors - my car has never been this clean. Or I take the keys and my wallet from a drawer when I am about to leave the house. I used it so far for simple things and nothing related to work, but I will do it.


## Benefits of habits accumulate

One of the points the book is trying to make is that habit building can be potentially very powerful if applied many times over, even on little things, since the benefits accumulate. In the book, James talks about the French cycling team getting better by a tiny bit in many different ways, which accumulated over time and helped them dominate the sport.

Once formed, the habits would stay and we can move on to a different habit, while reaping the benefits from the previously formed ones.

I personally think the upper limit of the accumulted benefits is not as high or easy to reach as the book suggests - it takes a long time to form a habit, and it takes mental effort to continue forcing it while it's built, meaning you can only work on so many habits at a time. And I also noticed that newly formed habits are fragile and it's easy to slip. Arguably that means they aren't formed, but then it just means it takes even longer to form them. If it takes six or more months to form a habit, how long would it take to start reaping accumulated benefits? 

Is building habits still worth doing? Without a doubt! I'm definitely doing it and will report back how effective it is soon.
