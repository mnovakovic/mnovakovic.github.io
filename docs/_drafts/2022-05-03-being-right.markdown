Most people wold agree that being wrong is percieved as a bad thing, and there is a lot of truth to that.
If you get the answer wrong on your school test or an interview, you might fail your test or not get the job.
If you bet your money on a company and the company fails, you lose money.
Very often, being wrong comes with a clear penalty.

Fine. But if we try to avoid being wrong, does that mean we have to be right?

I learned that perceiving the world in such a binary state doesn't lead to optimal results.
Being wrong can be thought of as a risk, so we can try to mitigate that risk.
Perhaps we can invest in multiple companies, or prepare for the tests better.
We can still produce a success, despite being wrong in some cases.

When it comes to personal relationships, it gets trickier.
At least when it comest to relationships being right or wrong is a bad way to look at the world and operate in it.

## Everyone thinks they are right

I started realizing that everyone thinks they are right after I read the classic "How to Win friends and influence people".
The book clearly states that everyone thinks they're right.
Once I read this I started realizing that this is very true.
I looked back at the conflicts that I had and realized that in all cases,
both sides thought they were right and the other side was wrong.

I realized I was the same way.
I tried so hard to prove others wrong, I would find articles, studies and other arguments that would prove my point.
But surprise - it never worked.
I started observing this - if the argument gets heated which usually means emotions are running high - even if you show
someone they are obviously wrong, they refuse to acknowledge that. For a second they might get taken by the realization
but after they collect themselves, they will start finding counter arguments and excuses as to why your proof is wrong.
Or sometimes they will just plainly resort to being rude.

I was the same - people would show me articles, studies, etc.
If those are done to prove me wrong I would never accept them, as I genuinely believe that those are eother flawed,
or are a strawman.

I switched my behavior. I just don't aim to being right any more as I know that it's a wrong approach.

## An algorithm for conflict resolution

This is the approach I use currently every time I try to communicate with a different team.

- Start by showing empathy: I now really try to understand the other side, and I explicitly state that.
    Everyone likes when they're being heard and are immediately more open to understanding your side of
    the story once you show you are willing to do the same.
    I know that any pushback most probably has a genuine reason behind it.
- Try to understand my own point of view.
    As the pushback/feedback starts pouting in, try to understand if you overlooked some aspects.
    Why did I do things this way? Was I too narrowly focused on my idea? How does it affect other teams?
    Did I cosider how my approach fits other people?
    Even if I do understand my point of view - did I communicate this well.
- Are we on the same page?
    If I understand my own point of view and we're past the point of heated arguments, are we on the same page?
    For example, a team recently requested that I make a major change somewhere.
- Search for the common ground? Is there a common set of interests that we can apply here? Can I change my approach to fix both.



## Learn to never be wrong

Another good suggestion is that instead of being right, you aim to not be wrong.
I read about this framing on Will's blog post [learn to never be wrong](https://lethain.com/learn-to-never-be-wrong/).
I highly recommend to give this post a read.
The ideas are very similar to what I described above and Will recommends not trying to prove anyone wrong, but to try to understand
everyone's point of view and aim to drive alignment that fits everyone's point of view, instead of trying to force your opinion on others.
