I have a couple of ideas that could be converted to blog posts.

## Potential blog posts about my previous projects:
- My memory usage breakdown project and how it kinda failed - I didn't communicate well, relied on other people too much and it took too much time to test and use. I also didn't market it very well
- The that project where I realized how it doesn't matter how much you know technically if someone has a different team name/better positioned manager
- The project that had the high levels of ambiguity and how it didn't fail but also did because I didn't communicate the risks enough
- How to read self help books. As in, how it's important to get the best out of it very quickly and how important it is to the main points to stick as opposed to going into every single detail of the book.
- How to approach people when you have conflicting situations. Similar to what I talked to James about, but give some concrete examples.

## Other themes that are related to skills
- How breaking down into pictures and graphs helps a lot
- The career/promotion document, and how it's important to write out the goals for the half and communicate and get agreement from others
- The importance of writing to sort out your thoughts
- The Practice I did with James - how to approach a conversation with empathy and get a much better response
- Talk about how reading a self help book or a blog post can help just by changing your perspective even though you thought it wouldn't help you
- How when you are stuck, going into any direction is useful because it will provide some answers "The obstacle is the way"
- How observing what's going on is very important. Obeserving and trying to be objective.

## Implemented:
- How letting go of having it your way can help both you and your peers [You don't need to be right](/thoughts/2022/06/03/being-right.html)
- The post-concussion project that didn't have enought impact and how I should have done the research first instead of just doing what I was told.
 Should have picked other projetcs to support instead of the one that was really not a good target for this [Assumptions In Inherited Projects](/thoughts/2022/04/22/undocumented-assumptions.html)
- Talk about how to get unstuck by going into any direction. Creativity by trying a lot and having a lot of ideas. [On ambiguity and being stuck](/thoughts/2022/02/27/creativity.html)
- How I always struggled with "yet another refactor" to my own detriment and discovered that it's because I wasn't aware of what the requirements are and how the only thing that matters is that the customers are happy
- How to build habits, by starting small and practicing often. For example, thinking about goals is hard at first but gets easier (habits post)
