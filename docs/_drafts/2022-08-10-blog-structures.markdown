As I mentioned in my habits-building post, I dedicate a few hours every week to blog writing. 
Doing this just further proved to me that writing is hard, and even though I was surprised by it many times I still underestimate it. There's always something important that I didn't think about enough.

Two examples of things that are important but not immediately obvious are the blog structure and the blog type.

Blogs have vastly different structures it turns out. I thought all you needed was the title, the introduction, the body and the conclusion, so I relied on that knowledge as I wrote my previous few posts. And the subtitles - you see them everywhere so my posts must have them too? It started becoming obvious that this doesn't hold even for my own blog: I do not really need a conclusion in a post that is in itself a conclusion on a certain topic. It can be there but it feels redundant.

There are also many different types of blogs. When I started this blog I knew that I wanted to talk about my observations and opinions about my career, so I didn't really think about the type of my blog. But I realized that some of my blog posts are pure observations, whereas some are more of guidlines backed by observations. These two require different approach, one can get philosophical whereas the other one should have a much more direct language.

This prompted me to dig a little deeper into technicalities of blog posts and how people I believe write well use titles and subtitles, and if the type of topic changes some aspects. Perhaps different topics work better with different structures?

One interesting thing I noticed immediatelly is that [Boz](https://boz.com) and [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html) **do not use subtitles**. Their posts are only paragraphs, and they are *often* short and very focused on their observations on one particular topic. Same for [Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/), but he adds some pictures here and there. Some of their posts also even offer advice but the advice is not formed under different subtitles or under bullet lists, which is what I did in my blogs and is something that is commonly used for that purpose. And this structure doesn't affect the readability **at all**.

[Mark Rabkin](https://medium.com/@mrabkin) for example has a much different structure in some of his blog posts. The posts are all advice and they have a very thorough step-by-step guide with a lot of pictures, bullet points and subtitles, and there is also a quote or a video added for good measure. [Will Larson](https://lethain.com/) has subtitles and bullet points and a few pictures here and there.

Another popular blog type is a technical tutorial, which differes from the essay/business/self-help types mentioned above. Their structure is obviously different: they have much longer texts, many pictures and videos, many subtitles and bullet points. All of this is expected from a tutorial and it actually makes them better.

As with any other writing, it all boils down to clarity.

The conclusion from all of this is that different types of blogs require different structure.
