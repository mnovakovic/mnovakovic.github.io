I have a couple of ideas that could be converted to blog posts.

## Potential blog posts about my previous projects:
- The post-concussion project that didn't have enought impact and how I should have done the research first instead of just doing what I was told.
 Should have picked other projetcs to support instead of the one that was really not a good target for this
- My memory usage breakdown project and how it kinda failed - I didn't communicate well, relied on other people too much and it took too much time to test and use. I also didn't market it very well
- The that project where I realized how it doesn't matter how much you know technically if someone has a different team name/better positioned manager
- The project that had the high levels of ambiguity and how it didn't fail but also did because I didn't communicate the risks enough

## Other themes that are related to skills
- How breaking down into pictures and graphs helps a lot
- The career/promotion document, and how it's important to write out the goals for the half and communicate and get agreement from others
- The importance of writing to sort out your thoughts
- How letting go of having it your way can help both you and your peers
- Talk about how reading a self help book or a blog post can help just by changing your perspective even though you thought it wouldn't help you

## Implemented:
- Talk about how to get unstuck by going into any direction. Creativity by trying a lot and having a lot of ideas. [On ambiguity and being stuck](/thoughts/2022/02/27/creativity.html)
- How I always struggled with "yet another refactor" to my own detriment and discovered that it's because I wasn't aware of what the requirements are and how the only thing that matters is that the customers are happy
